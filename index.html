					<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Skills learned at the Iron Yard Academy </h2>
					<p class="iron"> The Iron Yard Academy was a 12-week extensive and concentrated boot camp in which I learned a series of skills. We were sent home every night to with projects and a series of applications that we had to build and submit the next day. Every morning we had certain javascript functions in which we had to solve and figure out and create functions to answer the problem that would be in real job situations. Then we would spend the day learning a certain skill or code and also having to learn how to scour the internet to find extra resources to complete the homework assigment assigned to us. Ultimately the Iron Yard Academy did not only teach us how to code but gave me also the ability to learn different skills in a short period of time and to become independent with multiple skills. To see more work done at the Iron Yard Academy and apps that I built, you can visit <a href="https://github.com/Filusmarvin" class="hvr-grow" style="color:red">My Github Account </a>. </p>

						<p> When I applied to uBreakIfix, I was in a 7 man team lead position and right next to us was a web development department. When I went in there so they could fix something for me on the website, i seen the screen and it reminded me of the matrix. Just a bunches of 1's and 0's that I did not understand. What I did know was that I wanted to understand what ever they were writing and saying. I really grew an interest into it so I asked one of the leads in that department to teach me more about the coding. Ever since then I grew a passion for coding. The crazy thing is that I did not know that I had a friend that was coding that I would see on the daily basis. He was working with AAA as a web developer so I also started talking to him and he introduced me to the Iron Yard academy. After taking that course I feel like I can learn any thing. There is no code too hard for me to understand and that boot camp prepared me for the future and made me who I am today. That boot camp prepared me to learn and study more and seek more avenues like word press and angular even though react is my strong point in all of this.  </p>
